Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2:

HTTP -  Hypertext Transfer Protocol

HTTP1.1 introduced in 1997, The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web.

HTTP2 introduced in 2015, A new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.


It's a binary protocol rather than a text protocol. It can't be read and created manually. Despite this hurdle, it allows for the implementation of improved optimization techniques.

It's a multiplexed protocol. Parallel requests can be made over the same connection, removing the constraints of the HTTP/1.x protocol.

It compresses headers. As these are often similar among a set of requests, this removes the duplication and overhead of data transmitted.

It allows a server to populate data in a client cache through a mechanism called the server push.

Officially standardized in May 2015, HTTP/2 use peaked in January 2022 at 46.9% of all websites (see these stats). High-traffic websites showed the most rapid adoption in an effort to save on data transfer overhead and subsequent budgets.

This rapid adoption was likely because HTTP/2 didn't require changes to websites and applications. To use it, only an up-to-date server that communicated with a recent browser was necessary. Only a limited set of groups was needed to trigger adoption, and as legacy browser and server versions were renewed, usage was naturally increased, without significant work for web developers.
